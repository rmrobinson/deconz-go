# Monitor example

This example shows how to monitor the gateway for state changes. An example way to run this command would be to execute:

```
$ go run main.go --host=<IP of your gateway> --apiKey=<API key of the gateway>
```

If necessary, it is possible to get both the IP and the API key by following the documentation [here](https://dresden-elektronik.github.io/deconz-rest-doc/getting_started/).
